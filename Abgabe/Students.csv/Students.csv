It seems quite feasible and exciting! 3D metaverse platforms used in an Information Systems curriculum could elevate the learning experience, offering hands-on simulations and real-world applications. As technology becomes integral to the field, this approach aligns well with preparing students for the evolving landscape of information systems.","Especially the areas of Coding/Programming and Project Management can be educated in a modern and ""cool"" way. But also Modules about HCI could be from high profit.
But formost exercises could be elevated to a new level giving a real enviornment about tasks and thus creating more enjoyment and interests for students.","I would advocate for pilot programs or demonstrations showcasing the metaverse's benefits in enhancing interactivity and digitalization for information systems education. Collaborating with enthusiastic educators and involving students in feedback loops can highlight the positive impact on learning experiences. Emphasizing the potential for increased engagement, practical skill development, and alignment with industry trends could be key selling points to encourage adoption.","
3D metaverse platforms play a crucial role in engaging students by transforming course content into interactive, immersive experiences. Instead of traditional lectures, these platforms allow for hands-on simulations, collaborative problem-solving, and real-world applications, making learning more dynamic, exciting, and relevant to the field of information systems.","The biggest advantages is the easier participation and interactivity in metaverse taught courses. Usally there is barely any interaction between teachers and students but in this environment there would be many possibilities even for parallel interaction thus students could even learn independently from the progress of others in their own speed.","
Some potential challenges could include technical issues, accessibility concerns, and the need for training both educators and students to navigate and utilize the 3D metaverse effectively. Additionally, ensuring a balance between engagement and avoiding potential distractions might be a challenge in the implementation process.

The biggest is probably the lack of knowledge on how to implement it and the big amount of work to create these metaverse solutions.","The future role of 3D metaverse platforms in Information Systems education seems pivotal.

"2024/01/09 3:30:40 PM OEZ","They could bring a crucial change to education. Covid changed a lot already and metaverse education could be the next big change.","They will be the next step after Zoom/Teams and so on. Bringing new levels of interaction, collaboration and experience. Additionally there could be a more specialized learning offer for students by giving them a individuell education offer while still going back to a standardized offer.","There are many group based projects and seminars in IS. Those could be well educated and assisted with metaverse solutions focusing on Collaboration. Thus students could interact better and potentially even see the progress constantly.
Also Metaverse solutions give the opportunity to add a real backstory to projects and bring tasks more to life. Thus students could experience a more realistic scenario in which they can use their skills and knowledge which they acquire in the bachelor.","As mentioned before i belive it could greatly improve the collaboration and interactivity of IS modules. Students could profit from better understandable courses and unique/individuell learning experiences.

At the down side i belive that some aspects of in person learning would be lost, since socializing is a big part of studying and i think its different if you do it only virtually and not physically.","Technologies and Solutions are there but a big investment is needed considering the required equipment and also work to create the specific solutions tailored to IS.

In general it is feasible but it will take time fore sure.","Coding, Project Management, HCI.
Especially all courses like ECM where you talk about Scenarios could be well taught in the metaverse by bringing those scenarios to life.","I belive students are already interested but educators are the bigger problem. Since their learning material is often the same for many years and just reused. Thus metaverse solutions would be a big change. But also once they are created they allow educators to use the same scenario for many semesters.

Showing all participating parties the potential benefits should be the main focus to get everyone on board of the change.","The content can be tailored to their progress thus they might be more engaged by learning in their own speed. Now if you cant follow a lecture you  are just lost but in a metaverse taught lecture you could get additional information that helps you understand and follow the lecture better. The same is possible if you already know aspects of a lecture and you can simply skip or continue at certain aspects you want to focus on.","Interactivity, Collaboration and higher engagement.

Metaverse solutions in combination with ai could transform the education to a time independent learning experience. Students could potentially choose their courses as they want instead of not beeing able to participating because of member limitations or a not fitting schedule. Time and location could become irrelevant.","There will be a great change management needed since it is a big change. But also a big investment money and work wise.","Transforming the whole education to a student individuell and tailored learning offer.","Could be good since people would still need to be next to each other. Thus they would profit from physical aspects"
